>**For urgent problems please report to Matt Burleson, AP 346, mburleson@wcu.edu, x2239!***

# Definitions
1. **Standard Lens Mode** - A single lens mode that gives a large depth of focus with a small convergence angle.  The resolution is the weakest because the beam is focused so high up.  The ETD detector should be used for secondary electrons and T1 or DBS (optional) for backscattered electron imaging.
1. **Optiplan Lens Mode** - The default lens mode.  Optiplan lens mode adds an acceleration tube that is powered up to 8 kV.  When the electrons leave the column, they decelerate back to the starting voltage.  This acts as a fast lane for the electrons leading the electrons to have less time to repel each other, thus increasing resolution.  The second lens does the focusing.  The accelerating tube also pulls electrons back up into the column – which activates the in-column detectors (trinity detectors, detailed below), thus competing with the ETD.
1. **Immersion Lens Mode** - Similar to Optiplan lens mode, the immersion lens mode adds another lens (electromagnetic vs Optiplan's electrostatic) leading to the highest resolution, but least depth of focus.  Magnetic samples **CAN NOT** be imaged in immersion mode.
1. **Compound Lens Filter** - Combines electrostatic and magnetic immersion technology improving contrast with energy and charge filtering for imaging of insulating samples.
1. **Trinity Detectors** - Three in-column detectors.  These are further detailed below.
  1. **T1 detector** - The in-column backscatter (high angle) detector consisting of two segments (A & B) that can be assessed individually or in combination.  This detector is the closest to the sample.  A - B configuration will be good for topography while A + B will be good for material contrast.
  1. **T2 detector** - Secondary electron detector (middle angles and energies) that is a scintillator type detector.  Higher up in the column than T1, thus providing a strong compositional contrast.
  1. **T3 detector** - Secondary electron detector that is a scintillator type detector and highest up in the column.  This detects the lowest energy back-scattered electrons and is also the most collimated.  This detector is the most surface-sensitive detector, analyzing ~ 10 nm of surface layer and therefore can only be used in high-vacuum mode.
1. **ABS/CBS Detectors** - Angular/Concentric backscatter electron detectors.  The **inner rings** collect the signal on-axis with the primary beam which contains mostly channeling or atomic contrast information.  The **outer rings** collect large-angle backscattered electron signal containing mostly topographic information.
1. **STEM3/STEM3+** - Scanning transmission electron microscopy.  The primary difference is the segments of the detector being utilized. Both allow the analysis of bright field, dark field and HAADF (STEM3+ has **four** dark field segments compared to STEM3's one).
  1. **Bright field** - Sample contrast comes from absorbance of light in sample.  The background is white as the light source and condenser are arranged to fill the objective’s aperture completely with unscattered electrons, thus regions within the sample that are thicker/denser will appear darker.
  1. **Dark field** - Sample contrast comes from light scattered by sample.  No direct light enters the objective; the source waves pass by; the background is dark.  Only where the sample features diffract, refract, reflect or disperse the incoming light do they become visible.  Dark field is good for elemental contrast and grain boundaries.
  1. **HAADF** - High angle annular dark field - This mode collects diffracted or scattered electrons.  The image will contain elemental contrast information (similar to backscattered electrons), but it will not contain grain boundaries detail.
1. **Scan Interlacing** – Splits an imaging area into a large number of blocks defined by the number of lines (2 to 8).  The first line of each block is scanned, followed by the second one, etc.  This imaging method significantly reduces sample charging.  Scan interlacing **cannot** be used simultaneously with line integration.
1. **Line Integration** – scans each line repeatedly several times (from 2 to 512) before proceeding to the next line. Signal data collected from these passes are integrated and displayed as an actual image line. This imaging method reduces sample charging (in comparison with single pass with longer dwell time) and improves overall image quality.
1. **Drift Correction Frame Integration (DCFI)** - Corrects imaging drifting and charging when integration filter is active.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Definitions Continued
11. **Beam Deceleration Mode** - **High vacuum only** - an optical mode where the specimen is biased with a negative potential and primary electrons are decelerated before they land. The electrons generated by the primary beam are accelerated from the specimen, and as a result detected at higher energy than emitted.  The landing energy (EL) can be determined by (Acc.voltage – StageBias).  The specimen is part of the optical system and therefore must be mostly flat and parallel with the detector.  Very low to little signal in the ETD. Using BD mode a focusing lens is created between the negatively biased specimen and pole piece or detector above resulting in all the signal electrons accelerated towards the column or backscatter detectors as shown below.
<img src="bd.png" alt="Beam Deceleration" height="200"/>
1. **Crossover Mode** – The onscreen image shows an aperture projection instead of a sample, thus showing the electron source position instead of the sample surface for beam alignment.
1. **Mains Lock** – When enabled, the scanning is synched with the mains AC oscillation. This greatly diminishes blurring and jittering of the electron imaging, resulting in smooth image edges at higher mags with slow scan conditions.

1. Holding the **Ctrl** key of the keyboard and **clicking the S4** scanning preset will enable DCFI (see definitions), line interlacing or line integration (if applicable).
1. You will notice the scan speed drastically slows down (increases the dwell time), increasing the signal to noise.
1. Press the **pause** button to stop the scan automatically once the entire region has been scanned.
1. With your image complete, click **File** followed by **Save All...**
1. Save your image in an appropriate location and format using the File Save Settings dialog.  For example, 16-bit TIFF images are default, but 24-bit should be used for colored images.
1. As you navigate on your sample, if any of the beam conditions (accelerating voltage and/or beam current) were changed, the workflow of beam shift adjustment, crossover check, lens alignment should be repeated with each adjustment.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Imaging Tips
### Align feature
1. Allows the user to adjust the electron image so that a feature is brought to either the horizontal or vertical axis (user defined) to make navigation easier.
1. Click **Stage** followed by **Align Feature...**.  The Align Feature dialog will open.
1. On the quadrant of your choice, click and drag along an distinguishable feature in your image.
1. Back in the Align Feature dialog, select either the horizontal or vertical orientation and click **OK** to have the alignment procedure complete.

### Measurements
1. xT has measurement options for measuring features within your image.  These can be found under measurements shown below in yellow.
<img src="measurements.png" alt="Measurements" width="500" />
1. With these, you can measure feature sizes and angles.  The default color of these measurements is aqua, but can be changed using the Processing tab shown below in yellow.
<img src="processingtab.png" alt="Processing Tab"/>
1. When saving images with these measurements, ensure that **Overlaid graphics** is selected after clicking **Save All** and the format is a 24-bit TIFF.
1. Also within the Processing tab, the NavCam image can be digitally zoomed once its quadrant has been selected.  This will zoom in on the NavCam quadrant itself.

### Navigation Montage
1. Navigation Montage serves as a mini mapping of the sample within the xT Software.  Follow the steps below to use Navigation Montage.
1. Perform the initial focusing of your sample as described above.
1. Click **Stage** followed by **Navigation Montage...** towards the bottom of the dropdown menu.
1. The Navigation Montage setup dialog (below) will appear.  Select the quadrant that has your focused image in it.  In the example below, this is the top-left quadrant but you can select any quadrant that has beam control enabled.  Ensure **Use actual HFW** is checked.
<img src="navigationmontage.png" alt="Navigation Montage" width ="175" height="300"/>
1. Use the slider under **Result** to set the tiles of the resulting map you desire.
1. Under **Target Resolution**, 1536 x 1024 is the default and should be selected.
1. Click **Start** to begin the procedure.
1. When the procedure has finished, click the X in the top-right corner of the Navigation Montage dialog to close it.
1. When the procedure is finished, the quadrant you selected as the "take in display" will change to a navigation display(shown below in red).  Therefore, it is recommended to now use a different quadrant for imaging at your desired location (as shown below in yellow).  Click in any of the resulting tiles in the quadrant selected as the "Take in display" to navigate there.
<img src="montageresults.png" alt="Navigation Montage Results" width="500" />

### Acquisitions with the FlatQUAD (FQ) Detector (**HIGH VAC ONLY**)
1. Before anything, check the switch located on top of the FlatQUAD detector.  Set it to 20kV (indicated by a black arrow) if it is not already set as such.
 > **The FlatQUAD is a windowless detector meaning there is no window material protecting its detector elements.**

   ![FlatQuad Switch](sopfqswitch.png)
2. Lower the accelerating voltage to 20 kV (or lower) in Thermo's software **first** if it's higher than 20 kV.
 > **The FlatQUAD should never be used with a beam accelerating voltage greater than 20kV!**

3. Park the XFlash EDS.
1. Lower the stage as low as possible (45 mm).
1. Initialize the FQ by clicking anywhere in its box highlighted in yellow below.
<img src="espritopeningfqhighlighted.png" alt="Esprit with FQ Highlighted" width="500" />
1. Click the downward pointing arrow in the lower left-hand corner of **FQ** to launch the **FQ Configuration.**

1. Change the Mode from **Standby** to **Normal operation.**
 > **Under vacuum ONLY!**

8. Change Cooling to **Thermostat** to begin cooling the detector.  The detector should be cooled before moving into the acquisition position.  The cooling will take ~20 minutes.  The "Cooling system" readback will go from **on** to **ok** when ready.  When the software is closed, the detector will start warming back up.
1. Move the detector to the acquisition position.
> If STEM is desired with the FlatQuad detector, insert the retractable STEM detector in first and the FlatQuad in last.  **Remember to activate the CCD as the FlatQuad is inserted!**

10. With the detector cooled, in the acquisition position and calibrated by the Instrumentation Specialist, follow the instructions above under **Software Startup and Objects Acquisition.**  The working distance for the FlatQuad is 10 mm.
> **The CCD should remain on at all times until data collection begins.  This will prevent touching the detector.**

11. To Shutdown the FQ, park the detector first.  Slect **Detector Cooling Off**.
1. Launch the FQ Configuration window.
1. Click **Standby** under "Mode" once the detector is at 15C.  **<u>NOTE: You must wait at least 20 minutes after the FQ has been put in standby to vent the chamber!!</u>**
1. Close the software.
