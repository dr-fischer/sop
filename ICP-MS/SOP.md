# Operation of Perkin Elmer NexION 2000 ICP-MS
072023MB02
>**For urgent problems please report to Matt Burleson, AP 346, mburleson@wcu.edu, x2239!***

# Scope
This procedure details the operation of the ICP-MS including initial tuning and setup.
# Responsibility
Due to the inherent sensitivity of a mass spectrometer and the use of caustic solutions, gloves should be worn at all times when working at the front of the instrument.

**1 ppm should be the highest concentration.**

# Definitions
1. **Extended Dynamic Range (EDR)** - Extended Dynamic Range - provides an electronic dilution that enables the analyst to use the quadrupole in the universal cell to detune sensitivity on specific high concentration elements, so that they can be used with the same low concentration elements in the same calibration.  This mode can be useful for the detection of magnesium, calcium, iron and sodium.
1. **Dynamic Reaction Cell (DRC)** - A cell placed after the ion optics but before the mass analyzer quadrupole.  The DRC is capable of <i> both </i> ion-molecule collisions/reactions to cleanse the ion beam of interferents.  When used in collision mode,<i> Kinetic Energy Discrimination </i> is used to reject any undesired products.  When used in reaction mode, a reaction gas (ammonia, oxygen, etc.) is introduced into the cell to stimulate ion-molecule reactions.  The choice of gas is determined by thermodynamics to favor exothermic (spontaneous) reactions, due to the ionization potential of the interferent ion being much larger than the reaction gas.
1. **Kinetic Energy Discrimination (KED)** - One way to remove interferent ions.  A low reactive gas (typically He) is used to induce collisions with the polyatomic interferent.  Because the interferent has a larger collision cross-section (due to its larger size than that of the analyte ion), it will collide more frequently with the gas, and thus lose more kinetic energy.  By placing an energy barrier at the exit of the cell, the lower energy interferent can be eliminated.
1. **Axial Field Technology (AFT)** -  The Axial Field technology system improves DRC function performance by applying a linearly accelerating axial field to the DRC system. The net effect of the Axial Field technology system is that matrix effects are decreased, analyte signal is stabilized, and the speed of analysis is significantly improved.
1. **Peak Hopping** - A quantitation approach in which the quadrupole power supply is driven to a discrete position on the analyte mass (normally the maximum point), allowed to settle (settling time), and a measurement is taken for a fixed amount of time (dwell time). The integration time for that peak is the dwell time multiplied by the number of scans (scan time).  Multielement peak quantitation involves peak hopping to every mass in the multielement run.
1. **Background Equivalent Concentration (BEC)** -  The apparent concentration of the background signal based on the sensitivity of the element at a specified mass. The lower the BEC value, the more easily a signal generated by an element can be discerned from the background. BEC is a believed to be a more accurate indicator of the performance of an ICP-MS system than detection limit, especially when making comparisons of background reduction techniques, such as cool-plasma or collision/reaction cell and interface technology.  BEC is the background signal represented as an equivalent concentration and provides an excellent means of gauging the true magnitude of noise. The BEC can be calculated using the formula below:<center><div class="fraction">BEC = (I<sub>blank</sub> / (I<sub>standard</sub> - I<sub>blank</sub>)) * C<sub>standard</sub></div></center>
where <i>I<sub>blank</sub></i> is the intensity of the blank, <i>I<sub>standard</sub></i> is the intensity of the standard and <i>C<sub>standard</sub></i> is the concentration of the standard.

1. **Scan Time** - The mass analyzer scan time is the time it takes to scan from one isotope to the next.
1. **Quadrupole Ion Deflector (QID)** - An ion optics design that bends ion beam at right angles.  A software-controlled scanning voltage is applied to the QID to maximize the transmission of ions within a specific mass range into the DRC, thereby improving sensitivity, reducing interferences on the mass range of interest, and eliminating the transmission of photons and neutral species to the mass spectrometer.
1. **Isotope Ratio Measurements** - A specialized technique that enables measurement of the exact ratio of two isotopes of an element in a sample.  This technique is a sensitive indicator of age, reaction or metabolism in nuclear, geochemical or biomedical applications.  When you use the isotope ratio technique, you compare the isotope of interest to a reference isotope of the same element.
1. **Ion Getter Modes (IGM)** - The instrument has three IGMs:
  1. **STD/DRC QID mode**: (Pre-defined IGM; cannot be renamed or deleted) This default QID mode is optimized for Standard and DRC mode analyses.
  1. **KED mode**: (Pre-defined IGM; cannot be renamed or deleted) This default QID mode is optimized for KED mode analyses.
  1. **Cold Plasma mode**: (Pre-defined IGM; but CAN be renamed and modified as desired) This mode is still able to obtain extremely low DLs and BECs in both Standard and DRC mode (using NH3 ), but performs well on elements with Ar-based interferences or whose sensitivity is enhanced by the reduction of Ar ions in the plasma stream.

# Required Reagents
1. NexION Setup Solution.
1. NexION Rinse solution.
1. NexION KED Setup solution (if doing KED).
1. NexION Detection Limit STD/DRC Mode Blank Solution.
1. 5% Nitric Acid Solution (Made from Trace Metals Grade Nitric Acid).

# Gases and Startup
1. Turn the chiller on by pressing its power button.  Allow the chiller sufficient time to reach 15 C.
1. The ICP-MS uses argon gas for the plasma.  The argon can be turned on using the main valves of the four cylinders.

  >**85 - 95 PSI of argon is required!**

3. Wearing gloves, visually inspect the tubing of both peristaltic pumps for the autosampler and instrument.  Replace the tubing if there is any obvious holes or flat spots.
4. Wearing gloves, affix the tubing to the peristaltic pumps making sure not to cross over each line with another.  The pump on the ICP-MS rotates counterclockwise to introduce the sample into the spray chamber.
5. Clamp the tubing to the pumps.  The ICP-MS pump has a "Tube saver" feature, so you may observe it rotating clockwise and then counterclockwise
6. Open the Syngistix software by clicking the icon on the desktop.  The launch window of the software is shown below.
      ![Syngistix Launch Window](Syngistixmainscreen.png)
      > A red icon indicates a system fault.  The image shows an argon gas fault due to the cylinders being off as an example.

1. The instrument's cones, including the sample cone, skimmer cone and hyper skimmer cone, should all be inspected prior to use.  Replace any worn cone to ensure optimum beam transmission.
>**This requires training by Matt Burleson!**

8. With the cones inspected and satisfactory, the plasma can be ignited.
1. Click the toggle switch located under **Plasma** in the main Syngistix window.  The plasma ignition process will initiate.
>**Contact Matt Burleson if the plasma fails to ignite after two attempts.**

10. Allow the plasma to stabilize for 20 mins prior to any analysis, including the next steps.
1. The picture below shows the status screen after the plasma has been successfully ignited.
      ![Plasma On Status](plasmaonstatus.png)
1. Initialize the autosampler by clicking the **Autosampler** icon in the left-hand toolbar shown below in yellow.
      ![Autosampler icon](syngistixlefttoolbarautosamplerhighlighted.png)
1. Click the **Initialize** button to establish connection to the autosampler.  The screen should look like the image below if the communication is successful.
      ![Autosampler Initialized](syngistixautosamplerinitialized.png)
>Ensure that the probe is **NOT** sent to standby after batch completion.

14. Proceed to the Smarttune procedure after the plasma has had 20 minutes to stabilize.
