## Safety

- X-ray radiation is harmful. Never operate the instrument without the cover in place.  
- A ***green*** **X-Ray On** light indicates the X-ray source is turned off and it is safe to open the instrument.
- An ***orange*** **X-Ray On** light indicates the X-ray source is on.  Opening the door at this stage could expose you to X-rays.
